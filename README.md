# toxic_comments
My final project for the data science course where I created a model that aims to detect toxic comments. 

>> toxic_comments_de_unprocessed.csv -- Dataset
>> toxic_comments_model.ipynb -- In this Jupyter Notebook you can see how I chose between stemming and lemmatizing, selected the best vectorizer and best parameters for the models, and determined the best model for my task.
>> model.py -- File with code for the choosed model and parameters
>> streamlit.py -- File with code for the visualisation on Streamlit
